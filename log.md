**Today's Progress**: basic code to start working. Creation of the repository. creation of the 100dasyofcode documentation.

### Day 2: September 10, Tuesday, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Research, learning and beginning of creation of a recursive folder reader. Folders of sample i18n files have also been added for testing.

**Thoughts:** The result and progress has been less than expected. The functionality that had to be developed is not complete yet. It is necessary to increase the concentration in the project.
