# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 9, Monday, 2019  (Basic)
**Today's Progress**: basic code to start working. Creation of the repository. creation of the 100dasyofcode documentation. 

**Thoughts:** Only things have been installed. There have been no problems with this step. 

**Link to work:** [Commit Day 01](https://github.com/Gonzalo2310/i18nEdit/commit/e5f841458e55480bd0590200e6145c27544234f5)

### Day 2: September 10, Tuesday, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Research, learning and beginning of creation of a recursive folder reader. Folders of sample i18n files have also been added for testing.

**Thoughts:** The result and progress has been less than expected. The functionality that had to be developed is not complete yet. It is necessary to increase the concentration in the project.

### Day 3: September 11, Wednesday, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Alpha version of a recursive search function for folders and files. This functionality is the cornerstone of the whole further process.

**Thoughts:** Problems with promises. I have to practice them more. You get the expected results but you have to debug the process.

### Day 4: September 12 - 13, Thursday - Friday, 2019
**Today's Progress**: The cycle that will mark the current and future evolution of the editor's capacity begins. This path is a little delicate and I lack knowledge.

**Thoughts:** Today we have returned a little to the frustration of mishandled promises. This is an important stumbling block at a time when I need agility.

### Day 5: September 13, Friday, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Without success in the way of the previous day has changed strategy. In the end it's a good thing because the performance can improve that way.

The content that is not obtained immediately will be passed to obtain upon request in the use of the tree. This will avoid loading content that will never be used / consulted.

A "decent" visual result has been achieved. And it has been possible to verify that the function is recursive in a correct way.

**Thoughts:** Now I've got the bifurcated road. I must choose properly where to turn first. 
If I improve the existing code, create a system of variables for predefined values that later must be altered by the user or if I go ahead with the improvement of the object obtained from the result of the recursive function.

### Day 6: September 14, Saturday, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Programmatic changes:
* Use of private variables in objects. 
* Functions to read and assign object properties. 
* Added UUID to uniquely identify each node.
* Independence of the UI. An intermediate function extracts data from the object to the ui. This allows a change from UI to future with less problems.

**Thoughts:** The concept of Objects in Js is a bit particular. It makes me uncomfortable not to offer aesthetic changes as if no changes had been made.
I'm thinking of a possible migration to TS in version 2.
