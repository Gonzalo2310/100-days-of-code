### Day 1: September 9, Monday, 2019  (Basic)
**Today's Progress**: basic code to start working. Creation of the repository. creation of the 100dasyofcode documentation. 

**Thoughts:** Only things have been installed. There have been no problems with this step.

### Day 2: September 10, Tuesday, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Research, learning and beginning of creation of a recursive folder reader. Folders of sample i18n files have also been added for testing.

**Thoughts:** The result and progress has been less than expected. The functionality that had to be developed is not complete yet. It is necessary to increase the concentration in the project.

### Day 3: September 11, Wednesday, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Alpha version of a recursive search function for folders and files. This functionality is the cornerstone of the whole further process.

**Thoughts:** Problems with promises. I have to practice them more. You get the expected results but you have to debug the process.
